MyCAD
=====

MyCAD is a small passion-project (for now). I like to contribute to
[FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org), which is a great piece of software with a fantastic
community. However, I often find myself frustrated with the almost 20-year-old code base,
specifically when I find examples of anywhere from poor to downright dangerous coding
practices.

I issue to blame at all on the FreeCAD development team - the project started in the early
2000's, a time when c++ (and many things!) was a much different thing. Also, it is run by
a group of volunteers - we all do our best.

However, in an attempt to satisfy the OCD in me, I'm going to try a "ground up" approach
to what I think a CAD package should/could be.

Goals
=====

In general, I have some very concrete goals for this project:

1. Learn - I am not a trained programmer. I've learned what I know on the internet.
   Therefore, one of the first goals is to simply advance my knowledge of coding practices
   and paradigms.
2. Have Fun - I mean, come on: if you're not having fun, what are you doing?!
3. Be Disciplined - I want to be sure that whatever code is pushed to the master branch is
   solid, robust, and maintainable. I think the best way to accomplish this is with
   discipline, whether via coding practices, testing techniques, etc.
4. Document - my favourite libraries to use are those that are documented well. Therefore
   I want to provide that same opportunity to potential users of MyCAD.

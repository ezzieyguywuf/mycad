- run hlint on Geometry and GeometrySpec
- use Set as appropriate in Topology. We can then get rid of hasAny
- move pretty printing to it's own module
- re-evaluate if Geometry needs typeclasses
- update topo functions to return added value, or add a prime version of such functions
- update Geometry.getComponents to return a tuple.
- Figure out better way to get "last X" from Topology or even Entity.
- refactor Entity to use State monad better.
- Add test for "If removeXXX called with non-existent XXX, nothing happens"

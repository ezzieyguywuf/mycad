Licencing New Files
===================

The following has been taken directly from the GNU AGPLv3. Any new source files should
contain, at the least, the two lines listed, though preferably the entire block, as the
first lines in the file.

> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
>   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
>   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
> to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
> state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
> the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

>     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
>     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

> network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
> get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
> interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
> of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
> solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
> specific requirements.

>   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
> if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

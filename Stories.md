These User Stories will be used to develop new features. For the most work, new code
should be motivated by a Story from this list.

# Create geometric objects
**AS A** Desktop User \
**I WANT** to use my mouse to make geometric objects \
**SO THAT** I can visualize how these objects relate to each other \

**AS A** Remote User \
**I WANT** to send a request to make Vectors and Lines using specified geomtric information \
**SO THAT** I can later manipulate those objects in space

**AS A** Power User \
**I WANT** to use python to make geometric objects \
**SO THAT** I can automate my work flow. \

# Create topological objects

**AS A** Designer \
**I WANT** to create a Face from a collection of Edges \
**SO THAT** I can eventually use it to make some sort of Solid \

**AS A** Designer \
**I WANT** to create a Primitive Solid \
**SO THAT** I can use it to describe some physical object \

# Work with groups of topological objects
**AS A** Designer \
**I WANT** to group various topological entities in a "Document" \
**SO THAT** I can work on them iteratively and encapsulate them from other logical groups


# Completed Stories
**AS A** Designer \
**I WANT** to create lines in space \
**SO THAT** I can use them to make more complex geometry \

**AS A** Remote User \
**I WANT** to send requests to MyCAD server using TCP/IP \
**SO THAT** I can recieve responses and use the calculated geometry \
